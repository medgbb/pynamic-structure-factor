# ============= paral options ==================

# might try to 'tune' the parallelization here by splitting seperately
# over number of Q points per process (nqpp) and number of blocks per 
# process (nbpp). obviously, on each process, the loop over Q's and blocks
# will be sequential. i guess it would go like, for 2 blocks and 4 procs,
# nb = 2, np = 4, assign 2 procs to block 1 and 2 procs to blocks 1. then on
# in block, split the procs among the q-points
